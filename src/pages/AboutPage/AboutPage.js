        At this point in time I live in Winlaw BC, 45 mins outside of Nelson.
        I'm a father, stepfather and partner with strong roots in food and
        agriculture. Creative processes, recreating in nature and many things
        tech(primarily software dev) are what excite me these days. I'm a doer
        that loves entrepreneurship, collaboration, regenerative agriculture and
        cultivating collective experiences.   '{" "}

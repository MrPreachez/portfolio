      <p>
        I'm a father and a partner with strong roots in food, agriculture and
        community development. Creative processes, learning new things,
        recreating in nature and most things tech are what excite me these days.
        I enjoy using the intersections of my interests as fuel for learning.
        I'm a self motivated doer that loves collaboration, regenerative
        agriculture and cultivating collective experiences. Generally if I'm not
        in my office, you can find me skiing, biking, hiking or working on the
        farm.'{" "}
